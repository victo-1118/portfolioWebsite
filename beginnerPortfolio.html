        <div class="about">
            <p>Hello! My name is Victor Jimenez. I am currently a student at NC State University,
                born and raised in North Carolina. I am an aspiring software developer with a
                passion for both front-end and back-end development.
                Over time, I have worked on various projects to hone my skills and deepen my
                understanding of the field.
            </p>
    
            <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy working out and playing video games. My mindset is always
                to be better than I was yesterday, and I strive for continuous improvement in all aspects
                of my life.</p>

            <h2> User Authentication System (Backend) </h2>
            <h3> Purpose </h3>
            <p> I started this project to learn more about FastAPI and how I could use a database with it</p>
            <h3> Technologies used</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li> <strong>FastAPI</strong>: for building the web API </li>
                <li> <strong>Tortoise ORM</strong>: for making the database and its interactions </li>
                <li> <strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language </li>
                <li> <strong>JWT (Json Web Tokens)</strong>: Used to implement secure authentication </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Role </h3>
            <p> My primary role was to study and understand the existing code. I did not write any of the
                code but focused on dissecting every part
            </p>
            <h3> Learning process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Understanding FastAPI</strong>: I explored the basics of FastAPI, including 
                setting up endpoints, handling requests and responses and using dependency injection
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Understanding Tortoise ORM</strong>: I learned how to establish my database connection
                    , create models, used Tortoise ORM methods to help implement crud operations

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Implemented JWT</strong>: I learned about JWT tokens and how it is used for 
                    secure authentication including generation and verifying tokens
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3> Challenges</h3>
            <p> <strong>Challenge</strong>: Understanding the flow of user authentication and how different components interacted</p>
            <p> <strong>Solution</strong>: I broke down the code into smaller manageable pieces to understand what each part accomplished
                I also looked at tutorials and used Technologies like chat gpt to help me understand the reason behind some the code    
            </p>
            <p> <strong>Challenge</strong>: Ensuring best security practices</p>
            <p> <strong>Solution</strong>: I replaced any deprecated code with up to date methods </p>
            <h3> Learning and Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Skills Acquired</strong>: Gained a better understanding of FastAPI and Tortoise ORM.
                    Also Improved my knowledge of web security principles and authentication mechanisms.
                </li>
                <li> <strong> Insights</strong>: Understood I needed to learn more about file structure when creating RESTful API's 
                . Best security practices is also something I need to work on as I realize theres a lot to learn about that still.
                </li>

            <h2> To Do List API (Frontend and Backend)</h2>
            <h3> Purpose</h3>
            <p> My purpose for this project was to implement my better understanding of FastApi and Tortoise ORM</p>
            <h3> Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li> <strong>FastAPI</strong>: for building the web API </li>
                <li> <strong>Tortoise ORM</strong>: for making the database and its interactions </li>
                <li> <strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language </li>
                <li> <strong>Typing library</strong>: Used for type hinting which improve quality, readability and maintainability of the code </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Role</h3>
            <p> My primary role was to code the frontend and backend part of the project to solidify my understanding of FastAPI, Tortoise ORM and (frontend stuff)</p>
            <h3> Learning Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Continued further Understanding of FastAPI and Tortoise ORM</strong>: Implemented my what I understood from both of these technologies and continued to learn more features from them</li>
                <li><strong> Implemented and Understanding Typehinting in Python</strong>: Learned about Typehinting to begin to develop good habits and to make </li>
            </ol>
            <h3> Challenges </h3>
            <p> <strong>Challenge</strong>: How to implement a class that would act as a list that would take several Item objects</p>
            <p><strong> Solution</strong>: I learned that the fields library has a two methods that can help simulate a list. 
                By using .ReverseRelation() and .ForeignKeyField() I was able to establish a relationship between the two classes(List and Item) so that I could
                link Item objects to a List object which would be the only object that could access those Item objects.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: How to use pydantic models made from Tortoise ORM for typehinting</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I went to the Tortoise ORM documentation for help and saw that I just had 
                to create classes based on the variable names of my pydantic models created from Tortoise and pass them so that 
                I could use them for type checking.
            </p>
            <h3> Learning and Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skills Acquired</strong>: Learned how to simulate list and how to use pydantic
                    models created from Tortoise for typehinting. Also gained practical experience on how to
                    create RESTful API's, how I should set up my file structure and what order I should work 
                    for parts of the API
                </li>
                <li><strong>Insights</strong>: Understood that theres still a lot for me to learn about creating automatic tests.</li>
            </ul>
